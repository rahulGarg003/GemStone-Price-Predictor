# Gemstone Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the price of gemstones using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of a gemstone based on various features such as its carat weight, cut, color, and clarity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds). It contains information on over 50,000 diamonds including their carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and price.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

To run the project, run the following command:

`python application.py`


This will train the machine learning model using multiple algorithms on the dataset and give best model.

### Algorithms Used
1. Linear Regrassion
2. Lasso Regrassion
3. Ridge Regrassion
4. ElasticNet Regrassion

## Results

The results of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics will help to determine the accuracy of the model in predicting gemstone prices.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the price of gemstones based on various features. The results of the model can be used by jewelers and gemstone traders to make informed decisions about buying and selling gemstones.
